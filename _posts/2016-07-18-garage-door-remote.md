title:  "Garage Door Remote"
---

Some background on this project, I have a rather old garage door opener. The only remotes you can buy that are compatible are large and bulky sun visor mount types. I would like one that is smaller and able to mount to my key ring so I can use it with my motorcycle.

Knowing this I set off to make my own that met or more likely exceeds my requirments.
